## Getting Started

ESSENTIAL!
Before running the project, make sure to run in the terminal inside the project folder:
```npm install next```
(IF NOT ALREADY INSTALLED).

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

-> If the 3000 port is already in use by another process, the terminal may change the port, often to 3001, etc.
